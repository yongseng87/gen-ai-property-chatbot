    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Pipe Operator (|) in LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What does | mean here?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes — in LangChain's new \"LangChain Expression Language\" (LCEL), the `|` is operator overloading for pipe composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "It works a lot like a Unix shell pipeline (`cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3`), but instead of passing raw text, each component in LangChain has a well-defined input/output schema. The pipe (`|`) just wires them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "solution_template | llm | StrOutputParser()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "means:\n",
    "1. Take the PromptTemplate (solution_template)\n",
    "2. Format it with the given inputs → produces a prompt string (or messages)\n",
    "3. Send it to llm (the LLM model) → produces an LLM response\n",
    "4. Pass the response into StrOutputParser() → returns a clean string\n",
    "\n",
    "Each `|` passes the output of the left component as input to the right component, creating a seamless data flow pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chain vs Manual Steps Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌ Manual Approach (3 separate steps):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Step 1: Format the prompt\n",
    "formatted_prompt = prompt.format_messages(metric=metric_input)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 2: Call the LLM\n",
    "raw_response = llm.invoke(formatted_prompt)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 3: Parse the output\n",
    "result = parser.invoke(raw_response)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Chain Approach (1 simple step):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# All steps combined into one seamless pipeline\n",
    "analysis_chain = prompt | llm | parser\n",
    "result = analysis_chain.invoke({\"metric\": metric_input})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of Chains:**\n",
    "- **Less Code**: 1 line instead of 3 separate operations\n",
    "- **No Intermediate Variables**: No need to manage `formatted_prompt` or `raw_response`\n",
    "- **Automatic Data Flow**: Each component's output automatically becomes the next component's input\n",
    "- **Reusable Pipeline**: Create once, use multiple times with different inputs\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Built-in error propagation through the pipeline"

      "🔵 CALLING GPT-4O-MINI...\n",
      "\n",
      "🤖 OUTPUT FROM GPT:\n",
      "When analyzing a property that is 20 years old with recent renovations, several key factors should be considered:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Age of the Property**: \n",
      "   - A 20-year-old property is typically considered to be in the middle of its lifecycle. It may have some wear and tear, but if it has been well-maintained, it can still be a solid investment.\n",
      "   - The age can also affect the building codes and standards it was built under, which may differ from current regulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Recent Renovations**:\n",
      "   - Renovations can significantly enhance the property's value and appeal. It's important to assess the quality and extent of the renovations. Were they cosmetic (like new paint and flooring) or structural (like updated plumbing, electrical systems, or roof)?\n",
      "   - Renovations can also improve energy efficiency, which can lower utility costs and appeal to environmentally conscious buyers.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Market Appeal**:\n",
      "   - A renovated property may attract a wider range of buyers, including first-time homeowners and investors looking for rental properties. The appeal of modern amenities and aesthetics can lead to quicker sales and potentially higher offers.\n",
      "   - The location and neighborhood trends should also be considered. If the area is up-and-coming, the property may appreciate in value more rapidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Maintenance and Upkeep**:\n",
      "   - Even with renovations, it's essential to consider the ongoing maintenance needs of a 20-year-old property. Systems such as HVAC, plumbing, and roofing may still be approaching the end of their useful life, depending on the quality of the original installation and the renovations made.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Comparative Market Analysis (CMA)**:\n",
      "   - Conducting a CMA will help determine how the property compares to similar properties in the area, both in terms of age and renovations. This analysis can provide insights into pricing strategies and potential return on investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Financing and Insurance**:\n",
      "   - Lenders may have specific requirements for older properties, even if they have been renovated. It's important to check if the renovations meet current standards and if they will affect financing options.\n",
      "   - Insurance costs may also vary based on the age of the property and the extent of renovations.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Potential for Future Renovations**:\n",
      "   - Consider whether there is potential for further renovations or expansions that could increase the property's value. This could be particularly appealing to investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, a 20-year-old property with recent renovations can be a valuable asset, but it's crucial to evaluate the quality of the renovations, the property's overall condition, market trends, and potential future needs. This comprehensive analysis will help in making informed decisions regarding pricing, marketing, and investment potential.\n"

    "2. **Combine** retrieved text with user question  \n",
    "3. **Generate** answer using LLM\n",

    "| **\"map_reduce\"** | Summarizes each doc separately, then combines summaries | Long docs, complex analysis | Step 1: Summarize each doc → Step 2: Combine summaries → Answer |\n",
    "| **\"refine\"** | Builds answer iteratively, refining with each doc | Sequential reasoning needed | Answer using doc1 → Refine answer with doc2 → Final refine with doc3 |\n",
    "| **\"map_rerank\"** | Scores each doc's relevance, uses highest-scoring one | When only 1 best source needed | Score doc1: 0.9, doc2: 0.7, doc3: 0.8 → Use doc1 only |\n",

    "The `process_query()` method uses keyword-based intent detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Policy Keywords** (`\"policy\", \"drop\", \"appeal\", \"probation\", \"requirement\"`)\n",
    "   → **Route**: Knowledge Base Retrieval QA\n",
    "   → **Action**: Search educational policies and generate answer\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Student/Grade Keywords** (`\"student\", \"lookup\", \"info\", \"grade\", \"calculate\"`)\n",
    "   → **Route**: Agent with Tools\n",
    "   → **Action**: Autonomous tool selection (lookup student or calculate grade)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **General Support** (all other queries)\n",
    "   → **Route**: Conversation Chain with Memory\n",
    "   → **Action**: General educational guidance with conversation history\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Testing Strategy:**\n",
    "Tests three distinct query types to demonstrate all routing paths:\n",
    "- Policy question → Knowledge base retrieval\n",
    "- Student/grade query → Agent tool usage  \n",
    "- General support → Conversation memory"
